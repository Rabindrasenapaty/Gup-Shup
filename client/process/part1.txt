create authenticate ->login.jsx and signup.jsx
then make router for pages

react-icons
daisy-ui

//now adding redux tools
install tollkit and redux in client only
make a store folder and inside this slice folder and store.js
slice->userslice.js->paste from code


next is binding so in app.jsx binding process will start
understand teh process

i cannot directly call pages in reducer like login as it is a async function so i need to use redux thunk for this
