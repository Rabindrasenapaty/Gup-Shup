2 middileware & controller completed like register login getprofile and log out


now comes for message:
for sending message:required 3 things->senderId:req.user._id
                                        reciverId:requested from frontend->___/__/:receiverId(req.params.id)
                                        Message:req.body.message


                                        along with message we have to ensure conversation model

                                        if already talked:then conversation.find(s,R)
                                           else create.conversation(s,r)
                                                message create
                                                conversation.message.push(messageId)
